# my-containerized-app
I made this repository as the solution for Exercise 3.2: Deployment pipeline to a cloud service from the DevOps with Docker 2025 course by the University of Helsinki (MOOC.fi).

The goal of this exercise is to automate the deployment process of a containerized application. Every push to the repository triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Docker image and deploys the updated application to the configured cloud service.
